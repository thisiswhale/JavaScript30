    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players.team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //players =  ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'];
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'Joey';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'William leung',
      age: 40
    }
    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const will = {
      name: 'will',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@the',
        facebook: 'this'
      }
    }

    console.clear();
    console.log(will);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, will);

    //this turns to a sting and reconvert to JSON to make a COPY
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(will));
